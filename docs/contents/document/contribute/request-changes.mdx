## Before Submitting

Before submitting a feature request, please:

1. **Check existing requests**: Search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/issues) to see if someone has already suggested a similar feature.
2. **Read the documentation**: Make sure the feature doesn't already exist or isn't already planned in our roadmap.
3. **Consider compatibility**: Think about how your suggestion fits with the existing architecture and goals of the project.

## How to Submit a Feature Request

Please submit feature requests through our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/issues) page using the "Feature Request" template.

### What to Include

An effective feature request should include:

1. **Clear and descriptive title**: Summarize the proposed feature concisely.
2. **Problem statement**: Describe the problem that this feature would solve.
   - What are you trying to accomplish?
   - Why is it difficult or impossible with the current implementation?
   - Who else might benefit from this feature?

3. **Proposed solution**: Describe your idea for implementing the feature.
   - Be as specific as possible
   - Include mockups or diagrams if applicable
   - Consider edge cases and potential issues

4. **Alternative solutions**: Have you considered other ways to solve this problem?

5. **Implementation considerations**: If you have technical insights about how to implement the feature, please share them.

6. **Impact and importance**: Explain why this feature would be valuable to users and the project.

## Example Feature Request

```
Title: Add support for Docker container workflows

Problem Statement:
Currently, GitHub Action Reusable Workflows focuses on Python testing and deployment.
However, many Python projects also need Docker container building and publishing.
Adding Docker workflow support would make this more comprehensive for containerized applications.

Proposed Solution:
Add new reusable workflows for Docker operations:
- Build and test Docker images
- Multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64)
- Push to Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry
- Security scanning with Trivy or similar tools

The implementation should include:
1. New rw_docker_build.yaml workflow
2. Support for Docker Compose testing
3. Integration with existing test workflows
4. Proper caching for faster builds

Alternative Solutions:
1. Extend existing workflows with Docker build steps
2. Create separate Docker-specific workflow repository

Implementation Considerations:
This would require careful handling of Docker credentials and registry authentication.
Should support both Docker Hub and GHCR.

Impact and Importance:
This feature would greatly benefit Python projects that deploy as containers,
providing a complete CI/CD solution from testing to deployment.
```

## After Submitting

After you've submitted a feature request:

- Be responsive to questions about your proposal
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Consider contributing to the implementation if you have the skills

Thank you for helping improve GitHub Action Reusable Workflows!
