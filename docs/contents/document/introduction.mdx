# Introduction to GitHub Action Reusable Workflows for Python

GitHub Action Reusable Workflows for Python is a comprehensive collection of reusable CI/CD workflow templates designed specifically for Python library and package development. This project eliminates the need to configure the same CI/CD processes repeatedly across different Python projects.

## What is GitHub Action Reusable Workflows?

This project provides a set of battle-tested, production-ready GitHub Action workflow templates that can be easily integrated into any Python project. These workflows handle common CI/CD tasks such as testing, code coverage, deployment, release management, and more.

## Why Use Reusable Workflows?

In Python library development, teams often configure nearly identical CI/CD processes across multiple projects. This project addresses that challenge by providing:

- **Clarity**: Each workflow has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Simplicity**: Cleaner and more maintainable CI/CD configurations
- **Readability**: Easy-to-understand workflow configurations
- **Reusability**: Use the same workflows across multiple projects and repositories
- **Consistency**: Standardized CI/CD practices across your organization

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Testing Support**: Run unit tests, integration tests with multiple Python versions
- **Code Coverage Integration**: Automatic coverage reporting to Codecov, Coveralls, and Codacy
- **Flexible Package Management**: Support for both `pip/setuptools` and `Poetry`
- **Smart Release Management**: Automated version detection and GitHub release creation
- **Docker Support**: Build, test, and publish Docker images
- **Documentation Deployment**: Automated documentation building and deployment
- **SonarQube Integration**: Code quality and security scanning
- **Multi-OS Testing**: Test across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows

## Supported Project Types

- Standard Python packages (using `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`)
- Poetry-managed Python projects
- Nested Python projects with Poetry
- Docker-based Python applications
- GitHub Action reusable workflow projects

## Use Cases

- **Python Library Development**: Automate testing, building, and publishing Python packages to PyPI
- **Microservices**: Build and deploy Docker containers with automated testing
- **Documentation Sites**: Automatically build and deploy documentation using Docusaurus or similar tools
- **Multi-Version Testing**: Ensure compatibility across Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and beyond
- **Quality Assurance**: Integrate code coverage, static analysis, and security scanning into your pipeline
