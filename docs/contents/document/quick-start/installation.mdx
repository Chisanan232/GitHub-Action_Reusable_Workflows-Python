# Installation

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating GitHub Action Reusable Workflows into your Python project.

## Prerequisites

Before installation, make sure you've met all the [requirements](./requirements.mdx).

## Understanding Reusable Workflows

Unlike traditional packages, reusable workflows don't require installation in your project. Instead, you reference them directly in your GitHub Actions workflow files using the `uses` keyword.

## Step 1: Create Workflow Directory

Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository if it doesn't exist:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

## Step 2: Create Your First Workflow

Create a new workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`) in your repository:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run Tests
    uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/rw_run_test.yaml@master
    with:
      python_version: '3.11'
      test_type: unit-test
      all_test_items_paths: test/unit_test/
```

## Step 3: Reference Workflows

To use a reusable workflow, reference it with the `uses` keyword:

```yaml
uses: {owner}/{repo}/.github/workflows/{workflow-file}@{ref}
```

Where:
- `{owner}`: Repository owner (e.g., `Chisanan232`)
- `{repo}`: Repository name (e.g., `GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python`)
- `{workflow-file}`: Workflow filename (e.g., `rw_run_test.yaml`)
- `{ref}`: Git reference - branch, tag, or commit SHA (e.g., `master`, `v1.0.0`)

## Step 4: Choose Your Version Reference

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="branch" label="Branch (Latest)" default>
  ```yaml
  uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/rw_run_test.yaml@master
  ```
  
  **Pros**: Always get the latest features and fixes
  
  **Cons**: May introduce breaking changes
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="tag" label="Tag (Stable)">
  ```yaml
  uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/rw_run_test.yaml@v1.0.0
  ```
  
  **Pros**: Stable and predictable behavior
  
  **Cons**: Manual updates required for new features
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="commit" label="Commit SHA (Locked)">
  ```yaml
  uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/rw_run_test.yaml@abc1234
  ```
  
  **Pros**: Completely locked version, maximum stability
  
  **Cons**: No automatic updates, even for security fixes
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Configure Required Secrets

Add necessary secrets to your repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add the required secrets based on your workflow needs (see [Requirements](./requirements.mdx))

## Example: Complete CI/CD Setup

Here's a complete example for a Python project with testing and deployment:

```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  # Get all test items
  prepare-tests:
    uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/rw_get_tests.yaml@master
    with:
      shell_arg: test/unit_test/

  # Run tests
  run-tests:
    needs: prepare-tests
    uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/rw_run_test.yaml@master
    with:
      python_version: '3.11'
      test_type: unit-test
      all_test_items_paths: ${{ needs.prepare-tests.outputs.all_test_items }}

  # Organize coverage reports
  coverage:
    needs: run-tests
    uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/rw_organize_test_cov_reports.yaml@master
    with:
      test_type: unit-test

  # Upload to Codecov
  codecov:
    needs: coverage
    uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/rw_upload_test_cov_report.yaml@master
    secrets:
      codecov_token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
    with:
      test_type: unit-test
      upload-to-codecov: true
      codecov_flags: unittests
      codecov_name: my-project-tests
```

## Verifying Setup

After creating your workflow file:

1. Commit and push the workflow file to your repository
2. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
3. You should see your workflow listed and running (if triggered by your push)
4. Click on a workflow run to see detailed logs

:::tip Best Practices

- **Use specific versions** for production workflows (tags or commit SHAs)
- **Test with branches** in development to get latest features
- **Document your workflows** with comments explaining each job
- **Start simple** with basic workflows and add complexity as needed
- **Review workflow logs** regularly to catch issues early
