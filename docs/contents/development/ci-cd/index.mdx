# CI/CD Workflows

This section describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows used in the GitHub Action Reusable Workflows for Python project.

## üöÄ **Quick Navigation**

Our CI/CD system is organized into focused, developer-friendly sections:

### **üß™ [Test Workflows](/dev/next/ci-cd/continuous-integration)**

[![Python CI Multi-Tests](https://github.com/Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/actions/workflows/test_python_project_ci_multi-tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/actions/workflows/test_python_project_ci_multi-tests.yaml)
[![Poetry CI Multi-Tests](https://github.com/Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/actions/workflows/test_pyproject_ci_multi-tests_by_poetry.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/actions/workflows/test_pyproject_ci_multi-tests_by_poetry.yaml)

## üéØ **CI/CD Overview**

We use **GitHub Actions** to automate testing, code quality checks, and deployment processes. Our CI/CD pipelines help maintain code quality, ensure tests pass, and streamline the release process.

**Monitor all workflows at:** [GitHub Actions Dashboard](https://github.com/Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/actions)

### **System Highlights**

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**: Validates reusable workflows with real sample projects  
‚úÖ **Multi-Project Support**: Tests pip, Poetry, and nested project structures  
‚úÖ **Automated Releases**: Intent-based Git tagging and GitHub release creation  
‚úÖ **Version Management**: Branch-based workflow versioning for stable references  
‚úÖ **Advanced Documentation**: Automated documentation building and deployment  
‚úÖ **Developer-Friendly**: Extensive validation, staging, and troubleshooting guidance
